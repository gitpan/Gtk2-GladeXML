	* README: fix some of the info that looks like it was never touched
	after copying from Gtk2-Perl

	* GladeXML.xs: a pass at the custom_handler stuff, very close to what's
	in gtk-perl

	* GladeXML.pm: from what we can tell the method used to work around the
	lack of signal_connect_object (which is irrelivent with gtk2-perl)
	should be ok. this comments on the fact and cleans it up slightly.
