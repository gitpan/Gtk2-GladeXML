	* README, NEWS, GladeXML.pm: stable release 1.00

	* GladeXML.pm: add import version-checking, fix pod links.

	* Makefile.PL: fix requirements.  don't use postamble_docs, we don't
	have any XS that needs documenting.

2004/03/19 03:10 (-0500) muppetman

	* GladeXML.pm, README: beta release 0.96

	* README: fix the spelling of license; update the sandbox instructions.

2004/02/12 19:00 (-0500) muppetman

	* Makefile.PL: add_headers is a noop in ExtUtils::Depends >= 0.2,
	and doesn't do anything useful that install doesn't do in < 0.2,
	so take it out.  this avoids some noise on stderr as well.

2004/01/02 15:45 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: removed runtime_reqs stuff, replaced by the pkg-config 
	trick. use Glib::MakeHelper.

2004/01/02 15:45 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	the DATE subst that the specfile wants.

2004/01/07 14:58 pcg

        * GladeXML.pm: fix typoe reported by Florian Ragwitz :).

2003/12/29 16:32 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* perl-Gtk2-GladeXML.spec.in: use the new DATE replacement in
	conjunction with VERSION to create the changlog on the fly, which is
	better.

2003/12/03 23:57 muppetman

	* GladeXML.pm: update the docs.

2003/11/12 14:05 rwmcfa1

2003/11/11 01:01 muppetman

	* MANIFEST, debian/*: remove debian packaging files, since having
	them in the upstream dist makes things difficult for the packagers

2003/10/09 23:52 muppetman

	* Makefile.PL, GladeXML.pm, README, META.yml, debian/changelog:
	require the freshly released 1.00 instead of release candidates,
	and bump the version to 0.93.

2003/10/06 22:41 muppetman

	* GladeXML.pm: fix a couple of minor bugs that appear to have sneaked
	in during the port from gtk-perl.

2003/10/06 22:41 muppetman

	* GladeXML.xs: chas' changes to make custom widgets work, and update
	stuff to use GPerlCallbacks.  (i'm committing because chas has no
	'net access at home.)

2003/09/17 10:44 rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: ExtUtils::PkgConfig can now deal with version 
	requirements using pkg-config's interface, make use of it.

2003/09/16 23:50 rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL, perl-*spec.in: somewhat automated versioning system 
	implemented for depenancy modules

2003/09/15 22:26 rwmcfa1

2003/07/05 07:13 rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: put in a pre-req. of Glib >= 0.90, due to using
	gchar_own

2003/07/05 07:13 pcg

	* META.xml: added.

        * GladeXML.xs: use gchar_own to avoid memleak (untested).

2003/06/30 21:15 rwmcfa1

	quality release. Added pod documentation...

2003/06/20 11:28 muppetman

	* README: fix some of the info that looks like it was never touched
	after copying from Gtk2-Perl

2003/05/27 20:36 rwmcfa1

	* GladeXML.xs: a pass at the custom_handler stuff, very close to what's
	in gtk-perl
	
2003/05/27 10:57 rwmcfa1

	* GladeXML.pm: from what we can tell the method used to work around the
	lack of signal_connect_object (which is irrelivent with gtk2-perl)
	should be ok. this comments on the fact and cleans it up slightly.
